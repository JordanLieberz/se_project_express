   (I apologize my camera was not working :/)
   Check out [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HVIrysL2l-89H0onOam7ALaJyncsXPzC/view?usp=sharing), where I describe my project and some challenges I faced while building it.

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Using mongoose and express, we connected routes and a database in order to create users and clothing items for the database for our WTWR application. We also implemented error handling for errors that occur on all ends.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
